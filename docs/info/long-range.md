One of the most frequently asked questions that gets asked by people who are interested in, but haven't yet tried ELRS is "How far does it go, and at what packet rate?"

The following table is a leaderboard of the current record holder for each packet rate, and the longest distance from home. Note that not every flight resulted in a failsafe at max range, so the link may go (much) futher in some cases.

To enter, press the pencil in upper left corner of this page, and enter your record's info into the table, sorted by distance, and then PR it into the docs repo.

### Rules
Anyone can add an entry to the table, and entries should include the:
- Max distance from home
- RF freq (900 / 2.4)
- Packet rate
- Power level
- If the link failsafed at max range
- The pilot name
- A link to your DVR on youtube
