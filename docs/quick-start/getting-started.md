**Welcome to the ELRS Quick Start Guide!**

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    You should be comfortable navigating through your Radio Handset firmware (OpenTX/EdgeTX) and setting up models, as the guide on this website mainly covers setting up your radio for you to be able to use ExpressLRS.
    
    Likewise, you should also be comfortable with your Flight Controller firmware (Betaflight, INAV, etc), as the guide only covers setting up your ExpressLRS receiver to work with your flight controller firmware.

Please use the Navigation Bar at the bottom of each page for a more step-by-step approach, or use the Navigation Menu at the left to get to a Hardware-specific Guide.

Longer pages have a **Table of Contents** menu found on the right hand side of the page.

We hope these pages will help you get started with ExpressLRS and experience one of the best and most innovative RC links in the hobby.
