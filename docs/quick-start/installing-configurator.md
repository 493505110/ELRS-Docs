There are two ways to build & flash ExpressLRS. The recommended way is to use ExpressLRS Configurator. For advanced users who want to modify the code, you can setup the development toolchain.

## Configurator Setup

[Download](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases) the latest ExpressLRS Configurator application for your platform, following the instructions written by [jurgelenas](https://github.com/jurgelenas/).
