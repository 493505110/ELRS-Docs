TODO

We can put the other OpenTX settings here not covered in the [Preparing your Radio](../quick-start/tx-prep.md)

This could include the checking of Lua script for the CRSFShot or if the packets are dropping, etc.

We can also include how to check Telemetry data or getting the extra telemetry sensors.

ARM aux1 check and that it should low = disarm and high = arm

The one-meter-bench-test-at-10mw. Or the 10min "inactivity" test to make sure receiver will not lose bind or openTX will not scream Telemetry Lost (signs of overheating modules).

Any steps necessary prior to the first ExpressLRS Flight


**Done. Go Fly!**
