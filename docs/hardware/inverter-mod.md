- To benefit from the higher bitrate of 400 kilobit per second using `OpenTX`/`EdgeTX` you need to **add a pullup resistor to the inverter** of the serial port on the R9M 2018üóªüÜô
- Strongly suggested to be done for anybody looking for higher than standard packet rates using `ExpressLRS` üîÆ

## Identification

‚ö†Ô∏è This is only required for the 2018 version of the module which has a `ACCST` logo on the case üîç 

## Modification

Easy - connect a **300Œ© to 1000Œ© resistor** between the `3.3V` and inverter pin as shown on the picture üëß

## Transmitter Notes

Some Radios/Transmitters will require the Inverter/[Crossfire Mod](https://blog.seidel-philipp.de/fixed-inverter-mod-for-tbs-crossfire-and-frsky-qx7/) depending on the Baud Rate you want to use or you can use. 

| Radio | Baud Rate | Inverter/Crossfire Mod | R9M ACCST MOD |  Other Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| X9D | 400000 | Not Needed | Required | See [Troubleshooting](./x9d-troubleshooting.md) |
| X10S Express | 400000 | Not Needed | Required | - |
| X10S | 400000 | Required. [Modding Guide.](https://blog.seidel-philipp.de/fixed-inverter-mod-for-tbs-crossfire-and-frsky-qx7/) | Required | - |
| X12 | 400000 | Required. [Modding Guide.](https://blog.seidel-philipp.de/fixed-inverter-mod-for-tbs-crossfire-and-frsky-qx7/) | Required | - |
| QX7 | 400000 | Required. [Modding Guide.](https://blog.seidel-philipp.de/fixed-inverter-mod-for-tbs-crossfire-and-frsky-qx7/) | Required | See [Troubleshooting](./x9d-troubleshooting.md) |
| QX7 | 115200 | Not Needed | Not Needed | Max Packet Rate supported is 250Hz |
| Others | 400000+ | Not Needed | Required | TX16S, TX12, T16/T18, etc |

`ACCESS` radios doesn't need the Inverter/Crossfire mod.
