# Google Season of Docs: Project Page

Review and Expand ExpressLRS User Documentation - [expresslrs.org](https://www.expresslrs.org)

## About the organisation

ExpressLRS (ELRS) is an open source radio control (RC) link, with a primary focus on first-person view (FPV) crafts. ELRS aims to provide the best completely open source, high refresh radio control link, minimising latency while maximising range. A vast range of hardware in both 900 Mhz and 2.4 GHz frequencies is available.

FPV is a community built on top of open source projects such as [flight controller firmware Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight) and [RC handset firmware EdgeTX](https://github.com/EdgeTX).  ELRS fills a void for an open source and high performance RC link with an active development team of about 20 volunteers.

[github.com/ExpressLRS](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS) was created nearly 4 years ago and in the past 12 months has experienced significant growth.  Not only in code contributions, but also users and commercial manufacturers releasing ELRS compatible hardware.

## About the project

### The project’s problem

During early ELRS development users were required to Do It Yourself (DIY) and build their own hardware. This tended to attract tech savvy users. However, in the past 12 months a number of commercial manufacturers have released ELRS compatible hardware. A much wider user group now exists of varying knowledge and initial setup of ELRS can be troublesome. More so for users who are also new to FPV.

A review of the existing user documentation by a technical writer, who has not previously been exposed to FPV, will bring a fresh pair of eyes to the project and help identify knowledge gaps.

### The project’s scope

The ExpressLRS project will:

- Introduce the Technical Writer to the FPV community and teach them about flying a FPV multicopter… Lets try and have some fun first :smiley:
- Introduce the Technical Writer to troubleshooting procedures.
- This experience will help to identify any knowledge gaps in existing user ELRS documentation.
- Devs and Advanced Users will provide information on general user queries from project volunteers and assist with documentation on recurring issues.
- Review documentation used to assist manufacturers where English may not be their first language.
- Hopefully assist in a major release (ELRS V3) and release notes.

We estimate that this work will take 4-6 months to complete.

Work that is out-of-scope of ELRS project:
In-depth PID Tuning of RC vehicles (Multicopter, Fixed - Wing, Boat, Rover).
Auxiliary function of RC vehicles (Mapping, Package Delivery, Pest Control Drone, Weaponry).

## Measuring project’s success

The ELRS project runs a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/636441730280366) with over 8k users and [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/dS6ReFY) to help users troubleshoot setup issues.  A milestone of this work will be to see the number of users posting setup issues reduced, and to have documentation for all common issues presented in a user first perspective and mindset.

The project would be a success if we could provide a link to users for 90% of non software related bug issues.

ELRS Developers also volunteer a lot of time communicating with commercial manufacturers.  For a majority of the manufacturers English is not their native language and current ELRS documentation may be confusing.  A long term goal of the project is to minimise design errors in commercial hardware releases.

## Timeline

The documentation project will take approximately four to six months. It is expected the initial learning about FPV may take 4 - 8 weeks.  During which time the existing documentation can be used and reviewed.  The remaining time will be used updating and expanding existing user and manufacturer documentation.
ELRS has set its next major release goal before November to include release notes coordinated from this project.

| Dates | Action Items |
|:---|:---|
|May - June|Learning FPV and ELRS from scratch|
|July - August|Updating and expanding current User and Manufacturer documentation|
|September - October|ELRS V3 release notes and new feature documents|
|November|Project Completion|

## Proposed Budget

| Budget Item | Amount | Running Total | Notes |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Technical Writer | 10,000 | 10,000 | 26 wk, 6 hrs/wk |
| Technical Writer Hardware | 2,000 | 12,000 | FPV Hardware|
| Volunteer stipends | 500 | 14,500 | 2 ELRS Devs + 3 Adv User |
| Total | | 14,500 | |

## Additional information

The ELRS development team includes a range of expertise, from software professionals, academics, researchers, scientists, and university students.  And we love nothing more than nerding out on all things FPV in our free time :smiley:
